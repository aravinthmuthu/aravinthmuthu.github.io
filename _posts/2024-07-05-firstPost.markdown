Few cool things happened this week

My good friend is getting started with coding. She sent across her work as a github link. I git cloned it, and with little tinkering, got it working on my mac. Here I had a fully functional mindfulness bell with UI and text-to-speech capabilities running on my system, which happens to be my friend's first ever coding project.

My relationship with chatGPT has gotten more positive with this feat. I myself have started using it to learn and get things done. Many resistances to use it have fallen. Deploying this github.io page is my first proper use of chatGPT for a meaningful chunk of work.

I also happened to watch `Revolution OS` documentary this week. More power to open source!
